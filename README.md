# CLIP-Image-Cropping-Analysis
This repository explores the impact of image random cropping on CLIP classification performance.   

Dataset: 

The experiments utilize the mini ImageNet dataset.

If you want to run the code to crop images according to the object's bounding boxes, download bounding boxes from the official Imagenet data website: https://www.image-net.org/download-bboxes.php
